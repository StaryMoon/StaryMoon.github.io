My name is Minghao Liu, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jiaying Liu. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of World Models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Image Enhancement, with a strong focus on building more interpretable visual systems.
I graduated from the prestigious Turing Class at Peking University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2024. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about mentoring and have successfully coached students for the national informatics training teams of both China (CMO) and Australia (AIMO). I also used to hold **a national record in the CPS Test (Butterfly Clicking)** and achieved **third place in a national Nine Rings** competition (3min04s).
